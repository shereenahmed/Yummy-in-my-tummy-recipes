        <h2>The history and background of the Carrot Cake</h2>
            <p>Carrot cake is a cake that contains corrots mixed with butter. <br>
            The carrot softens in the cooking process, and the cake usually has a soft, dense texture.<br>
            Carrots have been used in sweet cakes since the medieval period, during which time sweeteners were scarce
            and expensive, while carrots, which contain more sugar than any other vegetable besides the sugar beet,
            were much easier to come by and were used to make sweet desserts.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The origins of carrot cake are disputed. Recipes for carrot cake occur as early as 1827. The oldest known
                recipe of carrot cake dates from 1892, in a book of the housekeeping school of Kaiseraugst
                (Canton of Aargau, Switzerland).<br> According to the Culinary Heritage of Switzerland, it is one of the
                most popular cakes in Switzerland, especially for the birthdays of children.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>The popularity of carrot cake was probably revived in Great Britain because of rationing during the
                Second World War.<br>
            Carrot cakes first became commonly available in restaurants and cafeterias in the United States in the early
                1960s.<br> They were at first a novelty item, but people liked them so much that carrot cake became
                standard dessert fare.<br>In 2005, the American-based television channel Food Network listed carrot cake
                , with its cream-cheese icing, as number five of the top five foods of the 1970s.<br> Carrot cake was
                voted as the favourite cake in the United Kingdom, according to a survey in the Radio Times in 2011.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Another story indicsates that following the Second World War there was a glut of canned carrots in the
            United States. A business man named George C. Page hired master bakers to find uses for the cans of carrots.
            He somehow promoted the idea of carrot cake to help create a demand for the product.</p>
